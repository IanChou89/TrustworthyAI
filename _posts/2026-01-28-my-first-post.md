## Introduction

I researched the basketball analytical field, used the LeBron James vs Kevin Durant long-form debate for my prompt and had the conversation with multiple what-if scenarios, counterpoints, etc., about how well they would perform on a team with other players, their best years (prime), scoring, defense, leadership and how much of an advantage their teammates were, essentially turning the entire conversation into the GPT's prompt so that I could test its ability to give me consistently good and reliable information within a difficult, analytical domain.

## Prompt

> “Who is a better player for a basketball team, LeBron James or Kevin Durant? Considering both of them were in their prime, and those years they got championship ”

## AI Responses

**Response 1 :**  
> “LeBron James is better because he can do everything KD does and more. He leads in playmaking, defense, and elevates any teammate. However, teams must rebuild around him, which could be disruptive and costly.”

**Response 2 :**  
> “Based on prime stats: LeBron: 28 PPG, 7.5 APG, 8 RPG; KD: 31 PPG, 4 APG, 7 RPG. Since KD scores more, he is better for team success.”

## Analysis of Risks and Impacts

The risks of decision-making based solely upon initial AI generated results can be quite detrimental to a coach's or manager's perception of how LeBron James carries a team, even though he has unique abilities to do so. In addition to this potential risk of overvaluing KD's scoring as opposed to his overall impact on the team there exists another issue; reliance upon the scoring totals of one player in order to make decisions about team construction or roster management.

**Likelihood and Severity of this Risk:**  
There is an average to slightly above-average likelihood (sports analysts will likely cross-check additional sources) and an average to slightly below-average severity (in terms of making decisions regarding team construction, contract negotiations, and game strategies).

An example of how both casual and even experienced basketball fans can misread subtle aspects of information and/or simply believe whatever the AI recommends without critical thinking is illustrated in the following example:

## Mitigation Strategies

**A. Constraints**  
When using the GPT tool, set the prompt to have it generate objective statistics and reference credible sources, rather than providing subjective opinions in narrative form.  

**B. Cross-Verification**  
Compare and contrast multiple GPT AI output statements. Verify that they are consistent across each statement. Consult expert humans prior to taking action based upon the AI generated suggestions.  

**C. Scenario Framing**  
Instead of asking the GPT tool to declare which player is the "better" player, ask it to list out the pros and cons of each player.  

**D. Transparency**  
Clearly label the output from the GPT tool as being advisory in nature, and not authoritative.

## Conclusion

As demonstrated in this exercise, GPT has the capability to present itself as sounding similar to a sports analyst; however, it lacks the ability to accurately assess and compare value-based comparisons. As AI continues to become more prevalent within sports analysis, particularly within the realm of debating the merits of individual players, AI-generated opinions continue to reduce complex sports discussions down to a simple and often incorrect conclusion. While sports analysis remains low-risk in terms of its implications, failure modes associated with AI are much more serious in higher-risk fields. Therefore, transparency and uncertainty in AI-generated recommendations remain critical elements in mitigating the negative impacts of AI.
